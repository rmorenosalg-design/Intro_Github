# Getting Started with GitHub

Welcome! This guide will help you understand the basics of GitHub and get you started on your learning journey.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform where developers store, share, and collaborate on code. Think of it as a social network for programmers, where you can:
- Store your code projects
- Track changes to your code over time
- Collaborate with others
- Share your work with the world

## Key Concepts for Beginners

### 1. **Repository (Repo)**
A repository is like a folder for your project. It contains all your project files and the history of changes made to them.

### 2. **Git**
Git is the version control system that powers GitHub. It helps you track changes to your files over time.

### 3. **Commit**
A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Think of it as saving your progress in a video game.

### 4. **Branch**
A branch is a separate version of your repository. You can make changes on a branch without affecting the main version of your project.

### 5. **Pull Request (PR)**
A pull request is how you propose changes to a project. It's like saying "Hey, I made some improvements. Would you like to include them?"

### 6. **Merge**
Merging is when you combine changes from one branch into another, usually from your working branch into the main branch.

## Your First Steps on GitHub

If you're new to GitHub, here's what you should do:

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up
2. **Complete This Course**: This repository is an interactive course that will teach you the basics
3. **Follow the README**: The main README.md file has step-by-step instructions
4. **Practice**: The best way to learn is by doing!

## How This Course Works

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically guide you through the learning process:

1. You'll start by creating a branch
2. Then you'll make a commit
3. Next, you'll open a pull request
4. Finally, you'll merge your changes

Each step builds on the previous one, and the repository will automatically update with new instructions as you progress.

## Common GitHub Terms
